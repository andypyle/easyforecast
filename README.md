# easyForecast
Simple weather forecast using AngularJS.

## About
This project was a way of learning how to consume third-party APIs using AngularJS. It uses [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) for the weather data.

## What I would like to do
I would really like to recreate this, and apply what I've learned about Angular over the last few months.

* Separate components(current conditions, week ahead, etc) in to directives.
* Move API consumption in to its own factory.
* Use `ng-bind='expression'` instead of `{{expression}}` to prevent template tags from showing up before data has loaded.
* Use SASS & Jade.
